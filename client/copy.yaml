    We get the data, run it through [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Objects-{}), then send it to the target URL. [Read more](#/documentation).

body: |
  You got a **service that sends webhooks** and you want to do use that webhook as **input to some other service**. Are you going to use _Zapier_? _IFTTT_? We provide a much flexibler way.

docs:
  summary: |
    When you [create an endpoint](#/create) you must define a **target URL** and a **modifier**, then you'll be assigned a **listening URL** for that endpoint.

    Whenever something gets `POST`ed to that listening URL, the JSON body contents of the request will be piped through the modifier and the result will be sent to the target URL.

    The modifier is a [jq filter](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Objects-{}) that builds an object based on the input data. If you're not familiar with _jq_, imagine that you got a webhook with the following contents:

    ```
    {
      "Type": "FruitEvent",
      "Date": "2009-10-25",
      "Entity": {
        "Type": "Fruit",
        "Id": "3784323",
        "Name": "Tomato"
      }
    }
    ```

    And you want to pipe that hook to a service that needs a JSON structure like the following:

    ```
    {
      "date": "2009-10-25",
      "value": "tomato",
      "kind": "currentFruit"
    }
    ```

    Then you write the modifier:

    ```
    {date: .Date, value: (.Entity.Name | ascii_downcase), kind: "currentFruit"}
    ```

    _jq_ is very flexible and you can transform data in almost anything using its filters. Try looking at its [manual](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/), [installing](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) it or [experimenting it online](https://jqplay.org/).

    ---

    More documentation will come. In the meantime, you can create an account, create an endpoint and test it with _curl_ and an [HTTP request inspector](http://webhookinbox.com/). You'll be able to edit the modifier and target URL if you're logged in.
