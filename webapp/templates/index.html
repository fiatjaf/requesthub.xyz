      <h4>Unleash the realtime power of the apps you use</h4>
      <p>Many online services provide actually very interesting webhooks, if only it weren't so complicated to setup a server to listen to each one of them parse, gather the important data and send it to another service! Save yourself time <!--and frustration-->while {{ config.SERVICE_NAME }} handle these tasks for you.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span6">
      <h4>No code, and yet maximum flexibility</h4>
      <p>{{ config.SERVICE_NAME }} reads the data from the incoming request, runs it through <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Objects-{}">a jq modifier</a>, then sends it to the target URL. With much less errors and debugging it's like writing a relaxed JSON template with variables and utility <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Builtinoperatorsandfunctions">functions</a>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span6">
      <h4>Step out of limited UI-heavy solutions for handling webhooks</h4>
      <p>Don't get trapped into IFTTT and Zapier crap. Now everytime you see a webhook you can cook a custom endpoint for it in 2 minutes and start dispatching notifications, storing data or making calls to other places. All under your fine control. Speed matters.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span6">
      <h4>Painless debugging</h4>
      <p>When you actually need to debug the modifier or inspect the target server responses, you can do it through {{ config.SERVICE_NAME }}'s simple interface, from where you can view incoming, outgoing and response bodies and <em>replay events</em> while being able to edit the endpoint definitions.</p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>When you <a href="/dashboard#/create">create an endpoint</a> you must define a <strong>target URL</strong> and a <strong>modifier</strong>, then you'll be assigned a <strong>listening URL</strong> for that endpoint. You may also specify a method other than <code>POST</code> and any HTTP headers necessary (with, for example, API credentials)</p>
      <p>Whenever something gets <code>POST</code>ed to that listening URL, the data sent with the request will be piped through the modifier and the result will be sent to the target URL. Other types of requests, including <code>x-www-form-urlencoded</code>, <code>PUT</code>s and <code>GET</code>s, are supported.</p>
      <p>The modifier is a <a target="_blank" href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Objects-{}">jq filter</a> that builds an object based on the input data. If you're not familiar with <em>jq</em>, imagine there is a service that sends JSON webhooks with the contents in the following format:</p>
      <pre><code>{
  "Type": "FruitEvent",
  "Date": "2009-10-25",
  "Entity" {
    "Type": "Fruit",
    "Id": "3784323",
    "Name": "Tomato"
  }
}</code></pre>
      <p>And you want to pipe that to a service that expects a JSON structure like the following:</p>
      <pre><code>{
  "date": "2009-10-25",
  "value": "tomato",
  "kind": "currentFruit"
}</code></pre>
      <p>Then you write the modifier:</p>
      <pre><code>{
  date: .Date,
  value: (.Entity.Name | ascii_downcase),
  kind: "currentFruit"
}</code></pre>
      <p>(<a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/xioW5M\">see this example in the jq playground</a>)</p>
      <p>And that's it.</p>
      <p><em>jq</em> is very flexible and you can transform data in almost anything using its filters. If you're curious, try looking at its <a target="_blank" href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/">manual</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/">installing</a> it or <a target=_blank" href="https://jqplay.org/">experimenting it online</a>.</p>

        <h5>How much does it cost?</h5>
        <p>While in the beta, everything is free. Later on, we will have some limits on the number of endpoints and webhooks handled per month. However we will probably grandfather people who used us during beta, if they are over the limit -- unless they're truly abusing the service, anyway, don't worry.</p>

        <h5>I want to connect 2 services using webhooks, but don't know how.</h5>
        <p>Great, we really would like to help. We will do it for you for a cheap price (starting at <em>$5</em> for simple tasks). Contact us through the form on the bottom and describe the task you want done.</p>

        <h5>Can I trust this for mission-critical tasks involving webhooks or other requests?</h5>
        <p>Not yet. When we are ready to provide such guarantees we will write that down in this page, but not yet. Consider using {{ config.SERVICE_NAME }} for personal tasks and not-so-crucial business tasks, that will truly help us improve.</p>
